## Camelia El K

I'm a French Londoner and I've worked several years in the wine industry and in Consumer research / Marketing. I've recently started to learn code. I've created a couple of programs on Ruby and a puzzle on Scratch.

I like to understand how things work and also to build things from scratch. Coding offers me both the mental challenge and the satisfaction of having made something entirely by myself.

Over the next months I'm interested in fleshing out my understanding of Ruby by working together with a couple of people on building something new and useful. I'm very curious and customer oriented and I have many ideas of apps, websites or simple software.


## Developer Skills

#### Ruby

I can write simple Ruby programs. My main qualities are that I write readable code and good READMEs.
