## Camelia El K

I'm a French Londoner and I've worked several years in the wine industry and in Marketing. I've recently started to learn code thanks to Makers Academy. I've created a couple of programs on Ruby and a puzzle on Scratch. I want to learn more Ruby in the next weeks and then Python.  I want to find a dev camp to join in August or September. After that I would like to either work part time as a junior developer in London or remotely.
